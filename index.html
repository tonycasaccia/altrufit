              I was introduced to Felix, and began training with him. On my
              initial assessment there was clearly some breakdown in my form and
              function which was uncovered. We worked together to build up my
              strength starting with ankle motion, mobility, and proper knee
              position over my foot. Once the basics were established, we
              focused on improving strength with a continued focus on
              integrating core strength connecting that upper and lower body. I
              felt stronger and more resilient. Ultimately this led to one of my
              strongest IRONMAN 70.3 runs, leading to a negative split without
              any breakdown in form. I highly recommend working with Felix.

              Felix Chiun is a superbly competent personal trainer who worked
              with me July-middle of October this year(2022). Reaching age 79
              and having had a knee replacement 7 years ago, and with the
              prospect of replacing the other knee, I limped badly with some
              pain. Felix led me through a series of stretching exercises at my
              pace and began working with me to build up the support muscles on
              both knees. He developed a variety of closely coached stretches
              and workouts. My knees got stronger and I looked forward to the
              sessions.

              I’ve been working with Felix for a year and my strength in and out
              of the pool has increased dramatically. More importantly, before
              working with Felix, I suffered from constant knee and shoulder
              pain. Since training with Felix, I’ve had none. He develops an
              individualized plan and tailors it to my training and competition
              schedule in the pool. He watches my races and analyzes what we can
              do in the gym to make my racing even faster. Felix works with me
              not only on the physical but my mental focus as well. His
              excitement and positive attitude makes working out fun and pushes
              me to work harder.

              Felix trained both my teenage boys who are nationally ranked
              competitive tennis players. His willingness to engage with them at
              a personal level, build trust, and then execute a fitness regimen
              that was customized not only to their abilities but also to their
              unique developmental life stage was remarkable. He built rapport
              and trust with them from the outset and genuinely cared about the
              tangible results of the time he spent with them in the training
              room. I would strongly recommend Felix as a trainer for both youth
              and adults.

              Im so happy to share my experience working with Felix! I started
              working with him because I had significant pain in my knees and my
              shoulders (mainly right shoulder). My job requires me to be at a
              computer all day and overtime, Ive developed constant pain. I
              would go for walks, stretch and try to figure out how to feel
              better but the pain never went away. Felix listened to what I was
              experiencing and worked with me to diagnose what was causing the
              pain and how I could correct it.
